My first website

This is my first time using HTML and CSS. I am learning from Mosh Hamedani's course which has taught me a lot so far. I plan to countinue my learning after finishing this website. I plan to be a back-end developer but the only way I will truley know what I am doing is if I learn the front end first. Once I get all the building blocks in place I will try to put them together into a website for my school.
